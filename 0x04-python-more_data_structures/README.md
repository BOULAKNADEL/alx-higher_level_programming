# 0x04[^1^][1]. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary[^2^][2]

## Description
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. In this module, we delve into more complex data structures in Python: sets and dictionaries[^2^][2]. We also explore the usage of lambda functions and the powerful map, reduce, and filter functions[^3^][3][^4^][4].

## Learning Objectives
- Why Python programming is awesome[^5^][5]
- Usage of sets and their common methods
- The difference between sets, lists, and when to use each
- How to iterate through sets and dictionaries[^6^][6]
- Understanding lambda functions and their use cases
- Implementing map, reduce, and filter functions[^4^][4][^3^][3]

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)[^7^][7]
- Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)[^8^][8]
- All files must end with a new line[^9^][9]
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`[^10^][10]
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory[^11^][11]
